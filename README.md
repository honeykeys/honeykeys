### 👨‍💻 About Me

Hey there! I'm a Software Engineer who thrives on solving complex problems with elegant and efficient code. My journey to software engineering has been anything but conventional, encompassing tech sales, data analysis, and culminating in a Master's in Computer Science from Queen Mary University of London. This diverse experience has given me a unique perspective on the entire software development lifecycle, from understanding user needs to building robust and scalable systems.

I'm passionate about writing clean, well-documented code, primarily in Python and Java, and I'm always eager to explore new technologies and frameworks. My GitHub profile reflects this passion, with projects ranging from a Tarot Reading Android Application to an ETL Pipeline for the Met. I'm particularly interested in data engineering and backend development. I have experience with SQL, various databases, and cloud platforms.

I'm currently seeking a challenging and rewarding Software Engineer role where I can contribute to a team that values innovation and continuous improvement. If you're looking for a dedicated and adaptable engineer with a proven ability to learn quickly and deliver results, I'd love to hear from you!
